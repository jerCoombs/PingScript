# PingScript
A network testing script built in Python.
It uses ICMP packets to measures latency and packet loss over time and then graphs the results to an image.

The script was developed by the Telstra Operations team End-to-End Service Analysis while trying to gague netork performance in remote 
contact centres.

PingScript can be run in 3 modes:
1) Ping a single host,
2) Ping multiple hosts,
3) Perform traceroute and ping each device in the route.

Download the latest version from the 'Releases' tab, which will contain an executable "PingScript.exe" file.
This program can be run directly by double clicking and following the on-screen menu system, or by running from a command line window.

Consult the documentation included in the release for more info.
